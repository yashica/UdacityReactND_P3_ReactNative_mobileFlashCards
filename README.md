# Mobile Flashcards

This is the project submission for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Native course.

Content of the project is an application that helps you to memorize facts by providing a mobile version of good old flash cards.
Add cards with questions and answers, organize your cards in decks and test your knowledge by taking a quiz on a certain deck.
Practice makes perfect, so if the user has'nt taken a quiz that day so far, the app notifies the user every day at 6 pm to take his daily quiz.

# Mobile Flashcards

The project was set up using create-react-native-app https://reactnative.dev/blog/2017/03/13/introducing-create-react-native-app.
The application is implemented using functional components, hooks, navigation V5 and uses useReducer, useContext and AsyncStorage for state management and persistance.
The project has been tested with the iOS emulator.

## üöÄ How to use

- Install packages with `yarn` or `npm install`.
  - If you have native iOS code run `npx pod-install`
- Run `yarn start` to start the bundler.
- Open the project in a React runtime to try it:
  - iOS: [Client iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id982107779)
  - Android: [Client Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&referrer=blankexample)

## Adding Native Code

This project can be run from a web browser or the Expo client app. You may find that you want to add more native code later on. You can do this by ejecting the project and rebuilding it yourself.

- Run `yarn eject` to create the native projects.
- You can still run your project in the web browser or Expo client, you just won't be able to access any new native modules you add.

## Publishing

- Deploy the native app to the App store and Play store using this guide: [Deployment](https://docs.expo.io/distribution/app-stores/).
- Deploy the website using this guide: [Web deployment](https://docs.expo.io/distribution/publishing-websites/).
